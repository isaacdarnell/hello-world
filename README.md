# hello-world
my first repository on GitHub

Hey there!

My name is Isaac. I am learning to code. 

Professional AV is my profession and I am an AV systems programmer and designer.

The control systems that we use leverage object based programming for high level customization.

I am currently taking a C# class on DevU and will start a python class on Udemy soon.

Bye for now!
